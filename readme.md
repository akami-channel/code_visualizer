text_to_texture.py doesn't work, probably because it is python2 stuff. It is old, from some random place on the internet.

attempt2.py should create an image called foo.png

archive directory has code that might become useful, but mainly just old junk

example_code directory is an example project for which I would like to build code visualization. Potentially any code could be used. We are still in the very early stages here in dev on this project.
